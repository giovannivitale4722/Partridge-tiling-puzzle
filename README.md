## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher is recommended for modern React/Vite projects)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/giovannivitale4722/partridge-tiling-puzzle.git](https://github.com/giovannivitale4722/partridge-tiling-puzzle.git)
    cd partridge-tiling-puzzle
    ```
    *(Added cloning instructions as this is the first step for a new user)*

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Available Scripts

-   `npm run dev` - Start development server for local development with hot-reloading.
-   `npm run build` - Compiles the project for production, optimizing assets into the `dist` directory.
-   `npm run preview` - Serves the production build locally for testing before deployment.
-   `npm run lint` - Runs ESLint to check for code quality and style issues.
-   `npm run deploy` - Builds the project and deploys it to GitHub Pages using `gh-pages`. *(Added the deploy script, as it's crucial for your project)*

### Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is configured for easy deployment to GitHub Pages.

1.  Ensure your `homepage` field in `package.json` and `base` field in `vite.config.ts` are correctly set to your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `https://giovannivitale4722.github.io/partridge-tiling-puzzle/`).
2.  Run the deploy script:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```
    This command will first build your application (`npm run build` via `predeploy` script) and then push the contents of the `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository. Your site will then be live at the `homepage` URL.
